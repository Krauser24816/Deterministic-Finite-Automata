# Deterministic-Finite-Automata
A program in which you get a list of some DFA. You can choose any option, enter a string in it and get to know whether it is acceptable or not to that DFA.


## Menu

#### Menu1(1-10)

| Option Number | What it do |
| :-------- | :------- | 
|    1       | `Starts with 0` |
|    2       | `Of length exactly 2` |
|    3       | `Of even length` |
|    4       | `Having 11 as substring` |
|    5       | `Having exatly 3 0's` |
|    6       | `Having atmost 3 0's` |
|    7       | `Having atleast 3 0's` |
|    8       | `Having even number of 0's` |
|    9       | `Having odd number of 0's` |
|    10       | `Starting with 10` |


#### Menu2(11-20)

| Option Number | What it do |
| :-------- | :------- | 
|  11       | `Ending with 10` |
|  12       | `Having 10 as substring` |
|  13       | `Having 0's in multiple of 3` |
|  14       | `Either ending or beginning with 01` |
|  15       | `Neither ending nor beginning with 01` |
|  16       | `Having even number of 0's and even number of 1's` |
|  17       | `Having odd number of 0's and odd number of 1's` |
|  18       | `Having even number of 0's and odd number of 1's` |
|  19       | `All binary numbers divisible by 3` |
|  20       | `All binary numbers divisible by 4` |

#### Menu3(21-23)

| Option Number | What it do |
| :-------- | :------- | 
| 21        | `Containig 3 consecutive 0's` |
| 22        | `Having 3rd symbol from right hand 1` |
| 23        | `Block of 5 consecutive symbols having atleast two 0's` |


#### Menu4(24-25)

| Option Number | What it do |
| :-------- | :------- | 
| 24 | `DFA that accepts all decimal numbers divisible by 3` |
| 24 | `DFA that accepts all decimal numbers divisible by 4` |
